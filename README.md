This is my PyTorch implementation of the STFGNN (Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Network) model proposed in 'STFGNN: Space-Time-Features Graph Neural Network for Traffic Flow Prediction' (arXiv:2012.09641).

The model is evaluated on the following PEMS (California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System) datasets, which can be obtained from the official repository at https://github.com/MengzhangLI/STFGNN

#### Model training
```
python main_4n0_3layer_12T_res.py --config config/XXXX/individual_3layer_12T.json

```
